globalConf.skip_gameinfo.tooltip=Forces MAME to skip displaying the system info screen.\nThe default is OFF.
#Global Input Options
globalConf.mouse=Mouse
globalConf.mouse.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME makes use of mouse controllers.\nWhen this is enabled, you will likely be unable to use your mouse for other purposes until you exit or pause the system.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.joystick=Joystick
globalConf.joystick.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME makes use of joystick/gamepad controllers.\nWhen this is enabled, MAME will ask DirectInput about which controllers are connected.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.lightgun=Light Gun
globalConf.lightgun.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME makes use of lightgun controllers.\nNote that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using -lightgun and -mouse together may produce strange results.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.multikeyboard=Keyboards Differentiation
globalConf.multikeyboard.tooltip=Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple keyboards.\nSome systems may report more than one keyboard; by default, the data from all of these keyboards is combined so that it looks like a single keyboard.\nTurning this option on will enable MAME to report keypresses on different keyboards independently.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.multimouse=Mice Differentiation
globalConf.multimouse.tooltip=Determines whether MAME differentiates between multiple mice.\nSome systems may report more than one mouse device; by default, the data from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a single mouse.\nTurning this option on will enable MAME to report mouse movement and button presses on different mice independently.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.global_inputs=Global Inputs
globalConf.global_inputs.tooltip=Allow MAME to read inputs even when it doesn't have the focus.\nThe default is OFF.
#Coin Specific Options
globalConf.coin_lockout=Coin Lockout
globalConf.coin_lockout.tooltip=Enables simulation of the “coin lockout” feature that is implemented on a number of arcade game PCBs.\nIt was up to the operator whether or not the coin lockout outputs were actually connected to the coin mechanisms.\nIf this feature is enabled, then attempts to enter a coin while the lockout is active\nwill fail and will display a popup message in the user interface (In debug mode).\nIf this feature is disabled, the coin lockout signal will be ignored.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.coin_impulse=Coin Impulse
globalConf.coin_impulse.tooltip=Set coin impulse time based on n (n<0 disable impulse, n==0 obey driver, 0<n set time n).\nDefault is 0.\n\nCoin Impulse refers to the amount of time a coin active signal is presented for triggering a credit.\nDuty Cycle refers to the amount of time from one coin active signal to the next coin active signal.\nSome titles require specific conditions for credits to be accepted such as duty cycle & coin impulse.\nFor example:\n- Tetris Plus 2 Requires > 70 ms signal to reliably trigger a credit (50 ms will cause credit instability),\n- Williams Titles (Defender, Joust etc.) require > 500 ms duty cycle for each credit to be accepted.\nExample usage:\n- Title refresh = 60 Hz\n- Coin impulse = 6\n1 ÷ 60 = 0.0166666'\n0.0166666' × 6 = 0.1 seconds (Or 100 ms)\nSetting the coin impulse to 6 on a 60 Hz title presents a 100 ms signal for triggering a credit.
#Light Gun Specific Options
globalConf.offscreen_reload=2nd Button As Offscreen Reload
globalConf.offscreen_reload.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a lightgun as a reload signal.\nIn this case, MAME will report the gun’s position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equivalent to an offscreen reload.\nThis is only needed for games that required you to shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if your gun does not support off screen reloads.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.dual_lightgun=Dual Light Gun
globalConf.dual_lightgun.tooltip=Controls whether or not MAME attempts to track two lightguns connected at the same time.\nThis option requires -lightgun. This option is a hack for supporting certain older dual lightgun setups.\nIf you have multiple lightguns connected, you will probably just need to enable -mouse and configure each lightgun independently.\nThe default is OFF.
#Machine Input Specific Options
globalConf.paddle_device=Paddle Device Assignment
globalConf.paddle_device.tooltip=Enable (none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick) if a paddle control is present.\n\nEach of these options controls autoenabling the mouse, joystick, or lightgun\ndepending on the presence of a particular class of analog control for a particular system.\nFor example, if you specify the option -paddle mouse, then any game that has a paddle control\nwill automatically enable mouse controls just as if you had explicitly specified -mouse.\nNote that these controls override the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.
globalConf.adstick_device=Joystick Device Assignment
globalConf.adstick_device.tooltip=Enable (none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick) if an analog joystick control is present.\n\nEach of these options controls autoenabling the mouse, joystick, or lightgun\ndepending on the presence of a particular class of analog control for a particular system.\nFor example, if you specify the option -paddle mouse, then any game that has a paddle control\nwill automatically enable mouse controls just as if you had explicitly specified -mouse.\nNote that these controls override the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.

inputDevice.keyboard=Keyboard
inputDevice.mouse=Mouse
inputDevice.lightgun=Light Gun
inputDevice.joystick=Joystick
#Screen Options
globalConf.brightness=Brightness
globalConf.brightness.tooltip=Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the brightness for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a darkened display,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a brighter display.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.contrast=Contrast
globalConf.contrast.tooltip=Controls the contrast, or white level, of the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the contrast for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.gamma=Gamma
globalConf.gamma.tooltip=Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the system screens.\nThis option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.\nUsing the MAME UI, you can individually set the gamma for each system screen;\nthis option controls the initial value for all visible system screens.\nThe standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white.\nSelecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black,\nwhile selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.pause_brightness=Pause Brightness
globalConf.pause_brightness.tooltip=This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused.\nThe default value is 0.65.
#Performance Options
globalConf.autoframeskip=Auto Frame Skipping
globalConf.autoframeskip.tooltip=Automatically determines the frameskip level while you’re running the system,\nadjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the system running at full speed.\nTurning this on overrides the value you have set for -frameskip below.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.frameskip=Frame Skip
globalConf.frameskip.tooltip=Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running.\nFor example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames.\nBy skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a system that requires more horsepower than your computer has.\nThe default value is -frameskip 0, which skips no frames.
globalConf.throttle=Throttle
globalConf.throttle.tooltip=Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on,\nMAME attempts to keep the system running at the system’s intended speed.\nWhen throttling is off, MAME runs the system as fast as it can.\nNote that the fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially for older systems.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.sleep=Sleep
globalConf.sleep.tooltip=Allows MAME to give time back to the system when running with -throttle.\nThis allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the system isn’t taxing 100% of your CPU resources.\nThis option can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.speed=Speed
globalConf.speed.tooltip=Changes the way MAME throttles the emulated system such that it runs at some multiplier of the original speed.\nA <factor> of 1.0 means to run the system at its normal speed.\nA <factor> of 0.5 means run at half speed, and a <factor> of 2.0 means run at 2x speed.\nNote that changing this value affects sound playback as well, which will scale in pitch accordingly.\nThe internal resolution of the fraction is two decimalplaces, so a value of 1.002 is the same as 1.0.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.refreshspeed=Refresh Speed
globalConf.refreshspeed.tooltip=Allows MAME to dynamically adjust the system’s speed such that it does not exceed\nthe slowest refresh rate for any targeted monitors in your system.\nThus, if you have a 60Hz monitor and run a system that is actually designed to run at 60.6Hz,\nMAME will dynamically change the speed down to 99% in order to prevent sound hiccups\nor other undesirable side effects of running at a slower refresh rate.\nThe default is OFF.
#Rendering Options
globalConf.keepaspect=Original Aspect Ratio
globalConf.keepaspect.tooltip=Enables aspect ratio enforcement.\nWhen this option is on, the system’s proper aspect ratio (generally 4:3 or 3:4) is enforced,\nso you get the system looking like it should.\nWhen running in a window with this option on, you can only resize the window to\nthe proper aspect ratio, unless you are holding down the CONTROL key.\nBy turning the option off, the aspect ratio is allowed to float.\nIn full screen mode, this means that all systems will stretch to the full screen size (even vertical systems).\nIn window mode, it means that you can freely resize the window without any constraints.\nThe default is ON.\n\nThe MAME team heavily suggests you leave this at default.\nStretching systems beyond their original aspect ratio will mangle the appearance of the system in ways\nthat no filtering or HLSL can repair.
globalConf.unevenstretch=Uneven Stretch
globalConf.unevenstretch.tooltip=Allow non-integer stretch factors allowing for great window sizing flexibility.\nVideo purists should stay far, far away from this option,\nwhile everyone else will be happy to know that it lets you fill the screen properly in full-screen mode.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.unevenstretchx=Uneven Stretch X
globalConf.unevenstretchx.tooltip=This option is the same as -unevenstretch but only affect the screen size horizontally.
globalConf.unevenstretchy=Uneven Stretch Y
globalConf.unevenstretchy.tooltip=This option is the same as -unevenstretch but only affect the screen size vertically.
globalConf.autostretchxy=Auto Uneven Stretch
globalConf.autostretchxy.tooltip=Automatically apply -unevenstretchx or -unevenstretchy based on source native orientation.
globalConf.intoverscan=Overscan
globalConf.intoverscan.tooltip=This option adds overscan to a screen when using integer scaling.\nOverscan is the part of a systems screen output which is generated outside the visible edge of a monitor.
globalConf.intscalex=Integer Scale X
globalConf.intscalex.tooltip=This option allows you to change the horizontal scaling of a systems screen output.\nThe value that you add to the command determines the scaling factor.\nThe default is 0 (auto).
globalConf.intscaley=Integer Scale Y
globalConf.intscaley.tooltip=This option allows you to change the vertical scaling of a systems screen output.\nThe value that you add to the command determines the scaling factor.\nThe default is 0 (auto).
#Rotation Options
globalConf.rotate=Auto Rotate
globalConf.rotate.tooltip=Rotate the system to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical).\nThis ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented systems show up correctly without the need to rotate your monitor.\nIf you want to keep the system displaying ‘raw’ on the screen the way it would have in the arcade, turn this option OFF.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.ror=Rotate Right
globalConf.ror.tooltip=Rotate the system screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise)\nrelative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified).\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.rol=Rotate Left
globalConf.rol.tooltip=Rotate the system screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise)\nrelative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified).\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.autoror=Auto Rotate Right
globalConf.autoror.tooltip=These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction.\nIf your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the system will fill the screen\neither horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.\nIf your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.
globalConf.autorol=Auto Rotate Left
globalConf.autorol.tooltip=These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction.\nIf your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the system will fill the screen\neither horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.\nIf your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.
globalConf.flipx=Flip X
globalConf.flipx.tooltip=Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (-flipx) or vertically (-flipy).\nThe flips are applied after the -rotate and -ror/-rol options are applied.\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
globalConf.flipy=Flip Y
globalConf.flipy.tooltip=Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (-flipx) or vertically (-flipy).\nThe flips are applied after the -rotate and -ror/-rol options are applied.\nThe default for both of these options is OFF.
#Artwork Options
globalConf.artwork_crop=Artwork Cropping
globalConf.artwork_crop.tooltip=Enable cropping of artwork to the system screen area only.\nThis works best with -video gdi or -video d3d, and means that vertically oriented systems\nrunning full screen can display their artwork to the left and right sides of the screen.\nThis option can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in the user interface.\nThe default is OFF.
globalConf.use_backdrops=Backdrops
globalConf.use_backdrops.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of backdrops.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.use_overlays=Overlays
globalConf.use_overlays.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of overlays.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.use_bezels=Bezels
globalConf.use_bezels.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of bezels.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.use_cpanels=Control Panels
globalConf.use_cpanels.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of control panels.\nThe default is ON.
globalConf.use_marquees=Marquees
globalConf.use_marquees.tooltip=Enables/disables the display of marquees.\nThe default is ON.
#Vector Options
globalConf.beam_width_min=Min Beam Width
globalConf.beam_width_min.tooltip=Sets the minimum and maximum width of the vectors.\nThis is a scaling factor against the standard vector width,\nwhich is interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's intensity.\nA value of 1.0 will keep the default vector line width.\nSmaller values will reduce the width, and larger values will increase the width.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.beam_width_max=Max Beam Width
globalConf.beam_width_max.tooltip=Sets the minimum and maximum width of the vectors.\nThis is a scaling factor against the standard vector width,\nwhich is interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's intensity.\nA value of 1.0 will keep the default vector line width.\nSmaller values will reduce the width, and larger values will increase the width.\nThe default is 1.0.
globalConf.beam_intensity_weight=Beam Intensity Weight
globalConf.beam_intensity_weight.tooltip=Applies an exponential weight to the minimum and maximum beam width.\nFor positive values the interpolated scaling factor will affect lines with higher intensity more than lines with lower intensity.\nThe default is 0.0.
globalConf.flicker=Flicker
globalConf.flicker.tooltip=Simulates a vector "flicker" effect, similar to a vector monitor that needs adjustment.\nThis option requires a float argument in the range of 0.00-100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum).\nThe default is 0.
